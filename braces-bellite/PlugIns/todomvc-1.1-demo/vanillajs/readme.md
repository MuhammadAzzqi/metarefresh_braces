# ![TodoMVC](https://raw.github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/gh-pages/media/logo.png)

We selected the excelent [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) to
use as demo content because it showed off the web-application nature that
Bellite was designed to address. We also selected TodoMVC because of the
excellence of the project and it's generous MIT license.

Thank you Addy & Sindre, and all the other contributors to the TodoMVC project!
