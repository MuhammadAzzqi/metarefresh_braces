# Bellite Demo using TodoMVC
We selected the excelent [TodoMVC][] to use as demo content because it showed
off the web-application nature that Bellite was designed to address. We also
selected TodoMVC because of the excellence of the project and it's generous MIT
license, and is a fantastic comparison of MV\* frameworks to help you select one.

Thank you Addy & Sindre, and all the other contributors to the TodoMVC project!

## Bellite API
This demo makes *very* cursor use of the [Bellite API][] to navigate to the
internally served TodoMVC application. It uses the [bellite-node][] package
to connect back to the Bellite-powered host application process.
